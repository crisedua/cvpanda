  # Fix Row Level Security Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies for cvs table
    - Add more permissive policies that won't block server operations
    - Ensure policies work with the anon key

  2. Security
    - Maintain basic security while allowing server operations

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all CVs" ON cvs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own CVs" ON cvs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own CVs" ON cvs;

-- Re-enable RLS with new policies
ALTER TABLE cvs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a more permissive policy for inserting CVs - allow server operations

-- Create a policy for users to insert their own CVs
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own CVs"

-- Create a policy for reading CVs
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read CVs"
